The EA will operate in real-time, leveraging both historical and live data to make buy/sell decisions. Data can be obtained via two primary methods:<br>- API: A free version that provides limited data for a single currency pair, and a paid version offering access to multiple pairs.<br>- Trading Platforms: FX Pro or XM, which will serve as direct sources for real-time trading data.<br>Additionally, the EA Robot will use an MQL5 script that defines the trading strategy, enabling automated trading on any MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. The core focus is to train an ML model for predictive trading, integrate data streams, and implement a scalable MQL5 strategy for execution.<br><br>Key Steps:<br><br><br>1.

Backtesting and Performance Evaluation<br>- Backtesting Framework Setup:<br>- Develop a system to test the model on historical data.<br>- Performance Metrics Definition:<br>- Define relevant metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdown).<br>- Strategy Backtesting:<br>- Run the model through historical data to evaluate performance.<br>- Results Analysis:<br>- Analyze backtesting results and identify areas for improvement.<br><br>5. Real-Time Data Integration<br><br>- Real-Time Data Handling:Set up continuous data feeds via APIs or FX Pro/XM platforms, fetching real-time trading data at regular intervals (e.g., 15 minutes).<br><br>Ensure that the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and normalized on the fly for live prediction purposes.<br>- Set up continuous data feeds via APIs or FX Pro/XM platforms, fetching real-time trading data at regular intervals (e.g., 15 minutes).<br>- Ensure that the data is cleaned, preprocessed, and normalized on the fly for live prediction purposes.<br>- Technical Indicators Calculation:Compute technical indicators on real-time data, ensuring the model uses up-to-date market conditions.<br>- Compute technical indicators on real-time data, ensuring the model uses up-to-date market conditions.<br>- Prediction Script:Develop scripts to apply the trained model to real-time data and generate buy/sell predictions.<br>- Develop scripts to apply the trained model to real-time data and generate buy/sell predictions.<br><br>6.
